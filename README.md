## Team: Pouteam

## Using the app
Node Server contains a Node JS server that hosts our website.
Instructions to install and run the server are in the folder's readme.

The website will ask for a name, a few genres and some tv shows that the user watched and liked.
It will then recommend new TV Shows to watch based on a recommendation algorithm.


## Recommendation Algorithm

Language used: Python
Machine Learning Libraries used: scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy


## UI design

Sketches were made with pen and paper (dropped in the ECSESS lounge).
We looked for a very simple and minimalistic design as it is functionnal and easy to do in a limited time frame.
We choosed to implement the application as a website because it seemed like the go-to way of displaying our desired UI.
The final result is slightly different to the sketches due to some tweaking.
